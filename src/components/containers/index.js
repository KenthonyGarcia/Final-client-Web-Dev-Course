/src/components/containers/index.js

This is a "barrel" file for the Container components, which combines all the exports of individual Containers
and makes it easier to import into App.js.

Note: A "barrel" file is a way to rollup exports from other modules into a single convenient module. 
The "barrel" (module) file re-exports the exports of other modules.
